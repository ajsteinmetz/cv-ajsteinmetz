\noindent
My research program investigates spin and magnetic moments in relativistic mechanics, addressing both quantum and classical regimes. Central to my work is the special role of the gyromagnetic ratio (g-factor), anomalous magnetic moment (AMM), and its connection to the algebraic structure of spin. In this framework, I explore classical, quantum, and macroscopic astrophysical processes; see \href{http://hdl.handle.net/10150/670301}{Steinmetz, (2023)}. I work with collaborators at the University of Arizona, ELI-Beamlines ERIC, Wigner RCP, and Texas U. I am the author, or co-author, of all included references.

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Quantum Investigations: Relativistic Spin Dynamics and Magnetism}}\\
We have studied generalizations of arbitrary magnetic moments for fermions (\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6587/aac06a}{Formanek et al., 2018}). In particular, we investigated the second-order fermion Klein-Gordon-Pauli (KGP) equation (\href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/i2019-12715-5}{Steinmetz et al., 2019}) in the following cases:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,nosep]
    \item \emph{Homogeneous Magnetic Fields:} We examine solutions of generalized second-order fermions in uniform fields, emphasizing the impact of the AMM on the energy spectrum.
    \item \emph{Hydrogen-like Atoms:} We extended the Coulomb problem to include AMM effects from KGP, thereby elucidating corrections to atomic spectra for high-\(Z\) systems; see Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}.
    \item \emph{Mass-Magnetic Moment Coupling:} We explore alternative approaches that couple mass with magnetic moment, providing new insights into relativistic quantum behavior.
\end{itemize}
Our work emphasizes the often-overlooked distinction between the KGP and the Dirac equations, as they present different physical solutions when AMM is present.

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Classical Models: A Covariant Stern-Gerlach Framework}}\\
On the classical side, my collaborators and I proposed a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force by introducing a magnetic four-potential. This framework \href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5493-2}{Rafelski et al., (2018)} covers:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,nosep]
    \item \emph{Extended BTMT Equations:} We modify the standard covariant Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi (TMBT) torque equations and introduce a novel secondary AMM that follows a different covariant structure than the traditional AMM.
    \item \emph{Ampèrian and Gilbertian Equivalence:} In this covariant framework, we unite the Ampèrian and Gilbertian descriptions of magnetic moments and show that the distinction between them can be understood in terms of external four-currents.
\end{itemize}
This model resolves longstanding ambiguities in the classical treatment of magnetic dipoles and provides a robust platform for further experimental and theoretical exploration. It has led to improved understanding of covariant motion in plane-waves for both charged and neutral particles (\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6587/ab242e}{Formanek et al., 2019}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.056015}{Formanek et al., 2020}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.052218}{Formanek et al., 2021}).

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Neutrino Physics: Electromagnetic Flavor Mixing}}\\
Extending these principles to neutrino physics, we have focused on (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos. Key points developed in \href{https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X23501634}{Rafelski el al., (2023)} include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,nosep]
    \item \emph{EM-Induced Flavor Mixing:} We explicitly demonstrate electromagnetic flavor mixing in a two-flavor neutrino model, showing that flavor mixing can be dynamically produced in strong electromagnetic field regimes.
    \item \emph{Dynamical Mass Basis:} Building on earlier work, we developed an EM rotation matrix that defines a dynamical mass basis, allowing a direct comparison of EM-induced neutrino mass splitting with the observed neutrino mass hierarchy.
\end{itemize}
This work offers a novel perspective on the interplay between EM fields and neutrino properties, with potential implications for understanding neutrino behavior in astrophysical environments.

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Cosmological Applications: Primordial Magnetization}}\\
Applying our theoretical developments to cosmology (\href{https://doi.org/10.3390/universe9070309}{Rafelski et al., 2023}; \href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.19031}{Rafelski et al., 2025}), we proposed a model for magnetic thermal matter-antimatter plasmas. In this model of spin-polarized plasmas, we examined:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,nosep]
    \item \emph{Electron-Positron Epoch:} We investigated the paramagnetic characteristics of electron-positron plasma subjected to an external primordial field, suggesting that the origin of primordial magnetic fields (PMF) may be related to the spin polarization of the hot dense plasma despite conventional wisdom that high temperatures disrupt magnetization (\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123522}{Steinmetz et al., 2024}).
    \item \emph{QGP Epoch:} We studied spin magnetization during the quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) epoch and estimated maximum bounds for spin magnetization; see Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}. We also suggested that electromagnetic-color dipole interactions could drive polarization prior to hadronization (\href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-025-01625-9}{Steinmetz \& Rafelski, 2025}).
\end{itemize}
This indicates that even a small polarization asymmetry in the plasma can generate magnetic fields with strengths consistent with those observed in deep intergalactic space. Further work has also improved the theory of fermion statistics in different temperature regimes (\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s10773-024-05695-8}{Birrell et al., 2024}).

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Future Research Goals and Projects}}\\
Building on our established work, I am pursuing several projects in various stages of development:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,nosep]
    \item \emph{Strong Fields in Classical and Quantum Physics Review:} (in preparation, 2025) A comprehensive review synthesizing recent advances and our contributions across classical and quantum domains. The first draft is complete and under internal revision.
    \item \emph{Magnetized Primordial Quark-Gluon Plasma:} (first author, in preparation, 2025) A follow-up to \href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-025-01625-9}{Steinmetz \& Rafelski, (2025)} investigating the role of magnetic fields during the QGP epoch with further theoretical and numerical developments of early-universe magnetization processes around hadronization.
    \item \emph{Electromagnetic Field Forcing of Dynamic CP-Violation in the Lepton Sector:} (first author, in preparation, 2025) A follow-up to \href{https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X23501634}{Rafelski el al., (2023)} which addresses how strong EM fields can induce dynamic CP-violation in the lepton sector, with potential implications for physics beyond the Standard Model.
    \item \emph{Anomalous Magnetic Moment in the QCD Vacuum:} (in preparation, 2025) An analysis focused on the behavior of anomalous magnetic moments within the QCD vacuum, emphasizing underlying non-perturbative QCD effects.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent\Large\textbf{Research Impact}}\\
Our research furthers our understanding of spin dynamics and strong-field effects. With this research program, I hope to push the boundaries of physics in the study of the primordial universe, quark-gluon plasma, magnetism, and relativistic quantum mechanics.

The research presented herein work deepens our grasp of the interplay between quantum and classical regimes, offering novel insights into the role of the gyromagnetic ratio and anomalous magnetic moments. These theoretical advancements enhance the precision of high-energy experiments and the modeling of astrophysical processes, thereby informing the design of next-generation instruments and diagnostic techniques.
